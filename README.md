# Scala-cheatsheet
A quick reference guide on Scala concepts, syntax, data structures, pattern matching, and more.

This code-bundle basically breaks down Scala syntax into sections with examples in order to help learn the Scala programming language. This is a great reference point for quickly searching up how to syntactically write Scala code containing examples of functions (including higher-order functions), pattern matching, data structures, recursion, and much more.
